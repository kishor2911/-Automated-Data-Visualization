# -Automated-Data-Visualization
🎉 We built an Automated Data Visualization & ML-Powered Insights Tool!

Our project is an interactive web application that makes data analysis & visualization effortless using Python and Streamlit. The idea was to create a platform where students, analysts, and professionals can explore their datasets without needing to write a single line of code.

📊 Key Features:
📂 Upload CSV/Excel datasets seamlessly
🧹 Automated data cleaning & preprocessing
📈 Generate interactive visualizations – bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, boxplots & more
📊 Statistical insights – mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, outlier detection
🤖 Machine Learning integration – regression & classification with accuracy scores
💡 Automated insights for better decision-making
🎨 Modern UI with a dark theme & background enhancements

⚙ Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Streamlit (for a fast & user-friendly web interface)
